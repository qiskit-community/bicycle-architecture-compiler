# Scripts Usage

- [`local_QA.sh`](./local_QA.sh) Performs locally the same checks that will be run on github upon making a pull request (PR).
   In practice, syncing local and remote versions of various components can be difficult. The result is that
   occasionally, local tests pass, while remote tests fail.

   See comments in [`local_QA.sh`](./local_QA.sh) for more details.
